Program collects user input
word is created
word is then hidden

user takes a guess

each time there is a correct letter the position of the hidden word is revealed
each wrong letter and the letter is added to the wrong letters. a stick is draw on illistration. 

if the user guesses all the letters before the hangman is drawn they win
if the user guesses too many wrong letters the user loses.



extras

user can only enter alphabetic characters
only the first letter the user types is used so user cannot type multiple letters
all inputs are converted to upper case
user cannot use a letter that has already been used.

How I tested:
I tested hangman using the word apple.
